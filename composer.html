    <a href="intelligentMachinery.html"><img src="img/IMImage.jpg" alt="Humanoid head with machinery attached to back"></a>
    <p>Intelligent Machinery was composed in 2015 as a commission piece for the
      Collins High School Titan Thunder Marching Band in Shelbyville, Kentucky.

    <h1>Sweetly While You Slumber</h1>
    <p>A concert band piece written for my daughter.  When she was young, I would sing and hum melodies to her before naps.  The main
    melody for this piece came from one of these naps.  I finished the wind and pitched percussion arrangement when she was 2.  Unfortunately,
    I have still yet to finish the non-pitched percussion part.</p>
    <p>The first section is a dialogue between parent and child (clarinet and flute).  The second section is contrasting harmonizations of the melody
    with woodwind and brass choirs respectively.  The third section is the struggle of the parent wanting the child to sleep, and the reluctance of the
    child to do so.  This is followed by a large chorale written to the speech rhythm of "A Child's Bedtime Prayer."  The conclusion is a duet, parent
    and child (again clarinet and flute), finally agreed on sleep.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy this work.</p>
    <p>P.S.  If any of my percussion friends want to finish the percussion, I wouldn't stop you.</p>
