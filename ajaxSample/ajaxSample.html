        <p>This is a sample page to show the integration of AJAX requests to a JSON file and some basic form creation and editing.
        The jQuery for accessing the JSON file can be viewed as a note in the Patient Intake HTML file.</p>
        <p>The JSON file contains data about patient name and their status of 'in' or 'out' of office.</p>
        <p>The page is responsive down to roughly 760px.  The design would be for tablets and computers, not for mobile applications,
        although it could be reworked later for that purpose with a resizing of the form.</p>
        <p>The links to Patient Allergies and Patient Rx are non-functional, as well as the submit button on the Patient Intake form.</p>
        <p>Again, this is a sample page to display certain aspects of front-end web development, and is not intended in any way to be a fully funtional site.</p>
        <p>Some form-styling snippets were used from https://www.sitepoint.com/style-web-forms-css/</p>
